Jodange,1,http://www.jodange.com,"Started in early 2007, Jodange is a text analytics provider, providing business tools for predicting outcomes and planning strategy by publishing the opinions of holders' sentiments over time.  Jodange automatically extracts opinions from online content in order to understand sentiment.  The company received a SBIR Phase I grant for a project entitled: Correlating Opinions with Outcomes in Business and Industry.  Their project combines methods from natural language processing (NLP) with regression and classification techniques from statistics and machine learning to determine the feasibility of associating opinions with outcomes in business and industry. The research objectives are the following: 1) Determine whether or not automatically extracted opinion information is associated with security value trajectories, with asset value trajectories, or with some other measurable value (e.g. market penetration of a product or product line) and, 2. Use predictive models to investigate which specific media sources and opinion holders are most influential and describe these influences on the outcome. The research builds on previous opinion-extraction research where information extraction and machine learning techniques from natural language processing were adapted to handle subjective language. This project focuses on research in statistical modeling where features/predictors derived from automatically extracted opinions will be used to augment predictions of interest to information analysts and decision-makers in business and industry. If successful, the project will result in the development of services that allow decision makers to better understand who and what is influencing their company, customers, competitors and marketplace, in an environment where trend-setting content originates from an exploding number of information sources.    Although project focuses on the uses of automated opinion analysis in business and the financial market, the techniques and services that will be developed are domain independent: they can just as easily be applied to opinions and outcomes in other industries or in politics, regulatory policy, foreign policy, sports and entertainment. The methods might also be used to track opinions on narrower topics of interest for users of the service, e.g. climate change, urbanization, sustainable architecture, their favorite presidential candidate. The market opportunity for text analytics is projected to grow from the current $700 Million to $2 Billion over the next three years.","Series A",2009-04-21,1.2,"BR Venture Fund;Dennis Bennie;Eyal Shavit;Nick Grewal","BR Venture Fund;Dennis Bennie;Eyal Shavit;Nick Grewal",1.2,Internet,"Internet Software & Services",,"United States","New York",Yonkers

Hunch,,http://www.hunch.com,"Hunch is developing an online decision engine.  The company was also known as DGP Labs.  Hunch aims to, in 10 questions or less, offer users a great recommendation to address their choice, problem, or dilemma, on thousands of topics. Hunch's recommendations are based on the collective knowledge of the entire Hunch community, narrowed down to people like the user, or just enough like the user. Hunch is designed so that every time it's used, it learns something new. That means, per the company, that Hunch's hunches are always getting better.    At the core of Hunch is a question selection algorithm.  The algorithm is always asking itself, &quot;What can I ask you next which will lead to the best possible recommendation for this topic&quot; The choice of which questions to ask and when to ask them will vary based on what the user has already been asked (and how the user answered) so far, the same way that a human expert would adjust a line of questioning based on your responses.     In choosing what to ask users, Hunch's question selection algorithm tries to do two things. First, it tries to find a question which will discriminate well among the remaining possible recommendation outcomes for the user - thus filtering the remaining choices from &quot;many&quot; to &quot;fewer&quot;. Second, the algorithm looks for a question which can help optimize and rank the remaining recommendation outcomes to present users with the ones they'll like the most. It's trying to ensure that the users will like outcome #1 better than outcome #5.    As users answer questions, Hunch can narrow down possible recommendations outcomes because each outcome can be &quot;trained&quot; to correspond with each question's answers. Any logged in user can set initial training or correct existing training, in addition to proposing new topics, questions to ask, and recommendation outcomes.     Hunch also uses machine learning based on statistical inferences.  When a user clicks &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; to indicate whether or not they like one of Hunch's recommendations, Hunch incrementally strengthens or weakens the mathematical correlation between that recommendation and any 'Teach Hunch About You' questions that have been answered so far. So over time, Hunch might hypothetically learn that people living in cities tend to prefer diet sodas, or that SCUBA divers tend to like bicycles with lots of gears. These type of algorithms are called machine learning.    In November 2011, Hunch was acquired by eBay for an acquisition price / valuation rumored to be $80 million.","Series A - II",2009-02-16,2,"Bessemer Venture Partners;General Catalyst;SV Angel","Bessemer Venture Partners;eBay;Founder Collective;General Catalyst;Khosla Ventures;SV Angel",19.2,Internet,"Internet Software & Services","Information Providers & Portals","United States","New York","New York"

fatdoor,,http://www.fatdoor.com,"The company just love it when a plan comes together. Unfortunately, that rarely happens without heroic efforts, hundreds of emails, and a fair amount of anxiety.  Who is going, where are the company going, when are the company going. Easy, right Well, not so much. In fact, no one has created an experience that combines of planning tools with of local search. And until someone does, the company will either continue to endure, or stop making plans altogether. Sigh.  But wait! At Center'd, we've been thinking about how to solve the challenges that exist in making plans. From the smallest get together, where users just can't decide on where to eat and oh-my-goodness-I-can't-take-it-anymore-maybe-I'll-just-stay-home-and-wash-my-cat, to the large fundraisers and school activities that require signups and hundreds of emails and weeks of meticulous planning, one thing is clear: The company can help users spend less time planning, and more time enjoying theirself.  The company do this by focusing on three categories:nnPeople - Connect to people users trust, and get their opinions and information to help users find that perfect place or make successful that successful plan.  Places - See what the crowds think by seeing ratings and reviews from across the web, or find out what their trusted friends think.  Plans - Easily invite friends, find out where everyone wants to go and when with place and time voting, empower volunteers to sign up for tasks, and stay on top of it with reminders and notifications.  The company's co-founders, Chandu Thota and Jennifer Dulski, each have a wealth of knowledge and expertise in local communities and information, but found that making plans was still wrought with peril. Each was already working in related fields: Chandu developed a iteration of Center'd (called Fatdoor), which focused on bringing neighbors together in an online community. Before that, he was at Microsoft as the lead engineer for its mapping products. Jennifer was at Yahoo! managing its local and marketplace businesses. They knew they needed help, so they found a talented underground team who escaped government persecution and were traveling the country solving crimes and performing odd jobs. After tracking the team down, it was clear these were the right folks for the challenge, and Center'd was born.","Series A",2007-11-23,5.5,"Keynote Ventures;Norwest Venture Partners","Comerica Bank;Keynote Ventures;Norwest Venture Partners",6,Internet,"Internet Software & Services",Social,"United States",California,"Palo Alto"

Hunch,,http://www.hunch.com,"Hunch is developing an online decision engine.  The company was also known as DGP Labs.  Hunch aims to, in 10 questions or less, offer users a great recommendation to address their choice, problem, or dilemma, on thousands of topics. Hunch's recommendations are based on the collective knowledge of the entire Hunch community, narrowed down to people like the user, or just enough like the user. Hunch is designed so that every time it's used, it learns something new. That means, per the company, that Hunch's hunches are always getting better.    At the core of Hunch is a question selection algorithm.  The algorithm is always asking itself, &quot;What can I ask you next which will lead to the best possible recommendation for this topic&quot; The choice of which questions to ask and when to ask them will vary based on what the user has already been asked (and how the user answered) so far, the same way that a human expert would adjust a line of questioning based on your responses.     In choosing what to ask users, Hunch's question selection algorithm tries to do two things. First, it tries to find a question which will discriminate well among the remaining possible recommendation outcomes for the user - thus filtering the remaining choices from &quot;many&quot; to &quot;fewer&quot;. Second, the algorithm looks for a question which can help optimize and rank the remaining recommendation outcomes to present users with the ones they'll like the most. It's trying to ensure that the users will like outcome #1 better than outcome #5.    As users answer questions, Hunch can narrow down possible recommendations outcomes because each outcome can be &quot;trained&quot; to correspond with each question's answers. Any logged in user can set initial training or correct existing training, in addition to proposing new topics, questions to ask, and recommendation outcomes.     Hunch also uses machine learning based on statistical inferences.  When a user clicks &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; to indicate whether or not they like one of Hunch's recommendations, Hunch incrementally strengthens or weakens the mathematical correlation between that recommendation and any 'Teach Hunch About You' questions that have been answered so far. So over time, Hunch might hypothetically learn that people living in cities tend to prefer diet sodas, or that SCUBA divers tend to like bicycles with lots of gears. These type of algorithms are called machine learning.    In November 2011, Hunch was acquired by eBay for an acquisition price / valuation rumored to be $80 million.","Series A",2007-11-09,5.2,"Bessemer Venture Partners;General Catalyst","Bessemer Venture Partners;eBay;Founder Collective;General Catalyst;Khosla Ventures;SV Angel",19.2,Internet,"Internet Software & Services","Information Providers & Portals","United States","New York","New York"

Appscio,,http://www.appscio.com,"Appscio, Inc. is the leader in the application of media analytics to government, enterprise and web media management problems. Appscio, a Freedom, CA-based company, was incorporated in 2007, by visionaries who anticipated rapid, widespread deployment of low cost digital video devices. The founders realized the central problem in managing the video from these devices is harvesting metadata from within the media to enable indexing and segmentation. Media analytics which generate this metadata have been developed with substantial government funding by hundreds of research projects and institutions. However, until today, their work was developed and deployed in proprietary, closed applications. No simple, standard mechanism existed for leveraging the work of others, bridging audio and video domains, or combining analytics. To address this problem, Appscio developed its open source, open architecture media processing framework. The Appscio Media Processing Framework (Appscio MPF) creates a plug-in architecture for video and audio analytics that allows Appscio, researchers, and customers alike to rapidly develop and deploy applications utilizing best-of-breed media analytics. Appscio sells applications and services built on the Appscio MPF, and sponsors an open source project to extend its capabilities. Appscio licenses, commercializes, certifies, tests, documents, benchmarks, and resells media analytics developed by others; for example, commercial entities, research organizations, and individuals. Appscio does not develop proprietary media analytics of its own.","Series A",2007-02-06,5,"ArrowPath Venture Partners;Red Rock Ventures","ArrowPath Venture Partners;Red Rock Ventures",5,Internet,"Internet Software & Services",Video,"United States",California,Freedom
